# Create Default Front Matter
To create our default front matter we need to create an archetypes file for your posts section.

> Archetypes files are content templates that contain preconfigured front matter.

- Create the directory `layouts\archetypes`

- Create the file `layouts\archetypes\posts.md`

- In your posts.md file, here is my front matter

# Create New Post

Now that you have your posts archetype template created, the last thing to do is create a new post which you can do by running:


`hugo new posts/my-post.md`
