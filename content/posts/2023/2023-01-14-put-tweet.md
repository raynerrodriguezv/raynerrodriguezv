# put tweet on hugo

Here is a tweet claiming how cool HelmUpgradeBot is: https://twitter.com/drsarahlgibson/status/1390312389346828291. All we need to embed this tweet into our blog post is the tweet ID (the numeric part of the tweet URL) and the user who tweeted it.

The syntax for embedding a tweet is then:

"`{{`< tweet user="TWIITER_USER_HERE" id="TWEET_ID_HERE" >`}}`"

Which is much shorter than the corresponding HTML!

So to add the above tweet to our blog post, edit the content/blog/my-first-post.md file again and add the following code to the end of the file.

`{{< tweet 1390312389346828291 >}}`
